# Alignment toy example notebooks

The goal of this project is to collect beginner friendly notebooks for demonstrating alignment concepts in toy environments and make them feel more tangible.

Todo:

- Instrumental convergence
- Goodharting (following the variants identified [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04585))
- Mesaoptimization (can be largely based off [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111))
- Deception (todo: figure out how to do this one)
- ELK (showing each proposal in ELK, and then showing a toy problem that breaks the proposal, etc)
- Wireheading (an environment where the AI can modify its own reward signa ldirectly)
